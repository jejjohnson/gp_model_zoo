# Model Zoo

## Implementations

### **[GPy](gpy/README.md)**

I wrap a few baseline algorithms that I tend to use quite often in my research.

**Wrapped**

* Exact GP
* Sparse GP (VFE, FITC, PEP)
* Stochastic Variational GP

---

### **[Pyro](pyro/README.md)**

I wrap a few baseline algorithms that I have been investigating in my research.

**Wrapped**

* Variational GP
* Sparse GP (VFE)
* Bayesian GPLVM

---

### **TODO**

I plan to release some of the algorithms I have wrapped for the following libraries:

* **GPyTorch**
* **GPFlow**
