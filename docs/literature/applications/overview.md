# Applications

---
## Surveys

All papers in this section look at applications in Earth observation e.g. parameter retrieval, time-scale modeling, remote sensing, and any data dealing with multi/hyperspectral imagery.

**A Survey on Gaussian Processes for Earth-Observation Data Analysis** - Camps-Valls et. al. (2016) | [Paper](https://www.uv.es/lapeva/papers/2016_IEEE_GRSM.pdf)

> This survey introduces GPs in a fairly simple way and lists a few basic GP algorithms. It also goes over some applications such as parameter retrieval, emulation and feature ranking. It's a great overview of GPs in the field from standard GPs. The software recommendations are outdated. I suggest you check out the GPy library for all GP algorithms mentioned in the paper. Also the treatment of sparse GPs (especially Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVNs)) is very brief and underrated. See [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01065) for more information about large scale GPs.
