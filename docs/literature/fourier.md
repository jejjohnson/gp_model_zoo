# GPs + Fourier Representations

> Any content related to GPs and Fourier representations

## Key Words

* Random Fourier Features
* Sparse Spectrum


### Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Processes

These are essentially the analogue to the random fourier features for Gaussian processes.

#### SSGP

1. Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process Regression - LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla et. al. (2010) - [PDF](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v11/lazaro-gredilla10a.html)
   > The original algorithm for SSGP.
2. Prediction under Uncertainty in Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Processes
with Applications to Filtering and Control - Pan et. al. (2017) - [PDF](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/pan17a.html)
    > This is a moment matching extension to deal with the uncertainty in the inputs at prediction time.

#### Variational SSGPs

The SSGP algorithm had a tendency to overfit. So they added some additional parameters to account for the noise in the inputs making the marginal likelihood term intractable. They added variational methods to deal with the

#### Uncertain Inputs

I've only seen one paper that attempts to extend this method to account for uncertain inputs.
