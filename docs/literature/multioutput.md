# Multi-Output Models 

In regression, this is when we try to learn a function $f$ or multiple functions to predict multiple output $y$ .

??? details "Details"
    
    Concretly, we are trying to predict $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times P}$ where $N$ is the number of samples and $P$ is the number of outputs.

## Terminology 

Firstly, there is some confusion about the terminology. I've heard the following names:

!!! info "Multi-Task"

    when we have different outputs. BUT possibly with different learning objectives and even different data types. e.g. one output is a regression task, one output is a classification problem, one output is a meta-learning task, etc. (a.k.a. the different tasks). The easiest parallel I can think of is self-driving cars. The objective is to drive, but you need to do many different tasks in order to reach the objective: drive without crashing.

!!! info "Multi-Output"

    typically when we have one task but just more than one output. e.g. multiple outputs for regression or multiple outputs for classification. So a concrete example is if we are predicting temperature and windspeed from some inputs.

!!! info "Multi-Fidelity"

    same as multi-output but catered more to situations where we know one of the outputs is of lower quality. e.g. a regression problem where one of the targets has less resolution or perhaps missing some data.

These definitions come from a discussion I had with the [GPFlow Community](https://gpflow.slack.com/archives/C144SAH60/p1588941862010600). I have yet to see a paper that is consistent with how these are done. I have broken up each section based off of their name but as seen from the names, there is a lot of overlap.
