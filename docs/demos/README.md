# GP Demos

> Just some demos of GPs being used across platforms. Most of them will be contained notebooks where I make comments as I go along. My audience would be newcomers to GPs using Python.

## Library Comparison

!!! abstract "TLDR"
    I did a few demos where I compare different libraries on toy datasets.


!!! info "1D Toy Example"

    * [**Small Scale**](./1d_example.md) Example
    > A 1D regression example with about 100 data points. I compare scikit-learn, GPFlow and GPyTorch.
