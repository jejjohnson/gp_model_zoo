# Algorithms Implemented

I did a light wrapper of the following algorithms:


**Variational GP**

* Prior Distributions: [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ViaPySxqicBp19AKvVRSuYjGHYzrWIP)

**Sparse GPs**

* Prior Distributions: [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LIeYFaJPiguN2GDj5tYS_YZbg_GazKDa)

**Sparse Variational GP**

### Observations

* I still haven't tested any of the algorithms to see if they work with minibatching. In principle, the stochastic variational algorithms should work but I would be curious to know if the VGP also works as well.
